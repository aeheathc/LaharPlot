*** Overview ***
----------------

LaharPlot is an application that can calculate and map out the inundation zone
of a lahar (volcanic mudslide) given an elevation map and some starting
parameters about the lahar itself.

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later
version.

*** Compiling ***
-----------------

LaharPlot depends on the following external libs:
- wxWidgets 2.8.10 or greater
- Boost 1.38.0 or greater
- GDAL 1.6.0 or greater
- (linux/etc only) libcurl, libpng, libjpeg, libgif

These all need to be built beforehand, seperately, to compile LaharPlot.
LaharPlot is built in two steps: the base system, and the GUI.

--- Base System:
The base system of LaharPlot consists of two command-line utilities -- the
stream finder (named 'stream') and the inundation zone mapper (named 'zone').
They can be used alone. They are still required if you decide to use the GUI.
These are built together using GNU Autotools.

0. Generate the config script
If there is already a file named "configure" (no extension) then skip this step.
If there is no config script, or if you run it and it complains about missing
files, regenerate it with the following command:
autoreconf

1. Run the config script
Configure needs to know where to find the libraries Boost and GDAL. The default
paths will look in standard Linux locations but if you have Boost or GDAL in
other places, or if you're running any other operating system especially Windows
in any situation you will need to specify locations. The simple options
--with-boost and --with-gdal specify Windows-friendly locations i.e. where the
libs and headers are together. You can specify seperate paths for the headers
and libs with --with-boost-incl, --with-boost-lib, etc. see './configure --help'
Additionally, if your platform is not Windows you will probably need to use the
option --with-linux to link the image libraries, otherwise GDAL will complain.
Note that running Configure on Windows requires MSYS+MinGW or some other way to
get Bash on Windows.
Keep in mind it will search for the Boost libs by their short name, for example
"libboost_thread.a" NOT "libboost_thread-mgw34-mt-1_30.lib" etc.
Use --prefix to name an install directory for 'make install'. Especially
important on Windows because it defaults to a Linux-friendly location.
A config on Windows might look something like this:
./configure --with-boost=c:/lib/boost --with-gdal=c:/lib/gdal --prefix=c:/L_Plot

2. Compile
Type the following:
make

3. Install
Type the following:
make install

X. Recap
These are the commands used above to build the base system of LaharPlot:
autoreconf; ./configure; make; make install

--- GUI:
The GUI is a friendly graphical program through which you can use LaharPlot.
It is just an interface and still requires the base system alongside it to do
the calculations.
The GUI resides in the 'plotter' directory. It was built with the IDE
"Code::Blocks" and the GUI tool "wxFormBuilder". It requires those tools to
efficiently edit it. Currently, the only supported way to compile the GUI is
also by using Code::Blocks. It will eventually be integrated into the same
autotools flow as the rest of the project. Until then...
Open Code::Blocks and make sure you correctly configure wxWidgets. The other
libraries (Boost, GDAL) are not needed here. Then click the build button.
If you run the GUI outside of the IDE it will want the wxWidgets shared library
either in the same place or in your PATH. You also need the 2 executables from
the base system in the same location as the GUI.

*** Usage ***
-------------
There are two ways to use LaharPlot -- with a GUI, or through the command line.
The GUI is not completely stable. For now, don't be suprised if it crashes.
Fortunately, command line usage is much more reliable.

--- GUI:
Run the executable named laharPlot. Choose "File > Convert DEM File" to
load a DEM (primary support is for SDTS files; others may work), then select a
lahar starting location on the map to open the zone mapper. Enter a volume in
cubic meters and let it run. It will show you the inundation zone and output a
TSV file containing a grid that is the same size as the DEM and marks the
inundated area.

--- Command line:
You need to pass a DEM through the stream finder ("stream"), which will create
the 4 terrain analysis files, with a common name suffixed by "sdem.tsv",
"fdir.tsv", "ftotal.tsv", and ".ini". You then provide the common name for these
files to the inundation zone mapper ("zone"), along with a lahar starting point
(x,y offset in cells within the DEM) and volume. This will create a file with
the suffix "zoneX" where X is the volume you chose. The zoneX file is a TSV file
containing a grid that is the same size as the DEM and marks the inundated area.
See the --help output for specifics on how to do all of this. For example:
stream --help
Not every option listed is necessary -- just the input/output options. If you
miss something, the programs will let you know what they need.
